Welcome to my blog! This is a place for me to write about random ideas I have, my thoughts on the world (because I'm a wise teenager with infinite knowledge), and my experiences through my last semester of high school and college. Plus I have the power of `code formatting` and \\(\LaTeX \\) so I'll be talking a bit about code and math. 

# A Bit About Me
So who am I? I'm a high school student from New Jersey learning to code and am finishing up my senior year. Throughout high school, I've worked for Fiveable, an edtech company tutoring for AP classes, specifically the AP Histories and AP Econ classes. In college, I hope to major in computer science and history. However, expect that to change at least 348209348 times. Over the last four years, I've jumped from CS to history to philosophy to physics and everywhere in between. All in all, there is one thing I love: learning.

A bit more about me, outside of school I love listening to and playing music. Over quarantine I've begun collecting records and as of writing this I have roughly 40 vinyls that I listen to on a daily basis. I also play the guitar and electric bass but trust me you don't want to hear that any time soon ðŸ˜¬. 

# What Will This Blog Be All About?
My biggest struggle hasn't been finding something I love, but finding something I _don't_! I don't write this thinking that's special or quirky but rather to explain that in these posts, everything is fair game. One day a post may be about a new library I'm tinkering with whereas the next may be on history and education, so stay on your toes.

# Send Off
Welp, that's about all I have to say to introduce you to my blog. In the future, these posts will probably have some sort of meaning but today it's just an intro.

Till Next Time,
Dylan
