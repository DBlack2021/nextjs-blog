# Introduction
Today, my most common response to a question is "I don't know, why don't you try googling it?" and if I have a question myself, I typically just pull out my phone open google, and have an answer within a few milliseconds. Hell, even if I need to learn an entire concept google usually does the trick as an opening move. Google usually takes me to YouTube, Wikipedia, StackExchange, or some other Reddit thread or forum full of people who are either extreme hobbyists or sometimes qualified experts in their field. This begs the question, what's the point of school today? If students have instant access to information for free (besides internet costs but this isn't my blog on social inequities quite yet ðŸ˜‰), what role should schools and more importantly teachers play in educating students?

# My Personal Experiences
In my experience, there's a spectrum of teachers with extremes at the the 'throw you in the deep end and don't look back' teacher and the 'spoonfeeding' teacher. 

The first side of this spectrum is the teacher who basically lectures to the class and expects you to learn it and then apply it entirely on your own, expecting personal effort and interest to carry you after their initial push. Tests from this teacher are *on* the material but as opposed to asking specific questions, they'll expect students to apply their knowledge to problems that require critical thinking. Very few of their questions if any can be described as a 'type' of problem.

On the other end, the 'spoonfeeding' teacher will teach every little detail about a topic to a class and then give them no expectation of critical thinking but rather will test specific question 'types' and often time, specifically in STEM classes, tests can be boiled down to questions that are virtual formula fill ins that require very little thinking nor application but rather algorithms. 

The major distinction between these sides of the spectrum are the degree of self-motivation expected and an expectation of content application and absorption.

## A Comparison
It may become more clear what I'm discussing if we look at an example. Let's take for example two math classes that both learn about polynomial division.

A teacher that expects may ask a question like: 

> A rectangular piece of metal on a mastcams of a Mars rover has a surface area thatâ€™s represented by \\( x^{2}âˆ’xâˆ’12 \\) in square millimeters. If the width of the piece of metal is \\( (x+3) \\) milimeters find an expression for the length of the metal.

This question, while not very difficult, requires a student to understand how to apply polynomial division. A student would have to identify that \\(SA = \ell * w \\) and then divide \\( x^{2}âˆ’xâˆ’12 \\) by \\( (x+3) \\) to get the correct answer, \\( (x-4) \\). This is a problem that is not a simple "division" problem, but instead takes a little bit of thinking to eventually get to a division problem which you can then use a procedure on. 

By comparison, a 'spoonfeeding' teacher would ask the same question as:

> The length of a rectangular piece of metal is \\( \frac{x^{2}-x-2}{x-4} \\). What is the length?

This problem has the same procedure but requires much less understanding of when to use division and rather asks students to carry out the procedure of polynomial division to obtain the same answer.

The primary difference between these two problems is not the content but the way it is presented. 

## Which Teacher is Best?

In my opinion as a student, both of these approaches have flaws. The teacher that throws students into the deep end will often have students who struggle with material and continue to struggle because they do not get the help they need. By contrast, a 'spoonfeeding' teacher may have objectively simpler material and questions, but their students will struggle to actually apply the information they learn in any situation other than the complete basic algorithm. 

The first problem presented out of the two in the last section is probably a better question and honestly a question that I would enjoy seeing on a test (enjoy meaning I'd think it was a good question). Teachers that expect more in depth understanding often ask questions that, although more rigorous, are more critical and are not necessarily hard. A 'deep end' teacher has many significant advantages in that students that do take to the material oftentimes learn way more than if they were in a class that did not expect any out of class motivation.

The main moral is that there has to be a balance struck between expecting students to learn on their own and apply their knowledge and being simple enough for comprehension and supporting your students. In STEM, the best strategy for fostering independent learning may be a flipped classroom model in which students learn at home and apply in school and the teacher is no longer the person shoving material down a kid's throat but is rather a coach of sorts supporting from behind the scenes and helping students directly when needed.

The points that I've made in this blog post most closely align to STEM where problems are dictated by formulas, procedures, and rules, but the same applies to english and history. If a student is spoonfed analysis of a piece of literature or a historical event as opposed to expected to come up with their own analysis and ideas, the consequenses could actually be more impactful than in STEM. 

# The Role of Teachers In An Instant Information World
As we become more entrenched in technology and a world where information is instantly accessible, the role of a teacher must change. A teacher's job should no longer be to teach material to students but rather to help them apply it to the real world. For example, in a math class, a student can learn the procedures and 'math' online for homework and then do practice throughout to establish understanding and then come into class with a few key things: familiarity, questions, and problems. The familiarity of students mean that teacher's oftentimes won't have to start from the *very* beginning but can instead focus on specific topics within a unit. Furthermore, learning can be targetted at what students want to learn and not just "here's all the content at once. learn it". Finally, students can spend lots of time on applying their knowledge either by learning critical thinking skills, labs, seminars, discussions, etc. and teacher's won't be bogged down by long lecture periods allowing for a more dynamic class environment.

# Conclusion
In conclusion, teachers are 100% needed in a technological world, but in a different form. As teachers transform from 'information machines' to teaching students **how** to learn and how to think critically and solve problems even if a set of steps is not clear. In any discipline, knowing how to think rather than what to think is crucial as we move forward.
